/**
 * Tests that gameplay cue events correctly trigger on all clients when triggered by a predicted gameplay effect application.
 * - Hosting project requirements:
 *	- GameplayCue.Test.Add and GameplayCue.Test.Execute need to exist in the list of gameplay tags in DefaultGameplayTags.ini,
 *	  otherwise the FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag calls in GC_SignalCueActivation fail when the test is loaded.
 *	- "/Game" needs to be added to GameplayCueNotifyPaths via DefaultGame.ini.
 *	  This avoids a warning being emitted from UAbilitySystemGlobals::GetGameplayCueManager the first time this test is run in a new editor instance.
 *	  This test does not require this path itself, however it matches the engine-provided default, and silences the warning.
 * - Setup:
 *	- One server, two clients.
 *	- The server spawns the test pawn, which has an Ability System Component (ASC) and the ability to be activated already granted to it.
 *	- The test pawn is possessed by client 1's player controller. This allows client 1 to activate predicted abilities on the pawn.
 *	- All workers wait until the test pawn has been replicated to them.
 * - Test:
 *	- Client 1 activates the ability on the pawn through a gameplay event with the "execute" tag.
 *	  Based on the tag, the activated ability applies an instant gameplay effect, which has the gameplay cue to be tested assigned to it.
 *	  This should trigger an "execute" event on the gameplay cue.
 *  - All clients wait until they have seen then gameplay cue receive an "execute" event exactly once.
 *  - Client 1 activates the ability with the "activate" tag.
 *	  When activated with this tag, the ability applies a gameplay effect with duration,
 *    which should cause "OnActive", "WhileActive" and "Remove" events on the gameplay cue.
 *	- All clients wait until they have seen the gameplay cue receive an "OnActive" event exactly once.
 * - Cleanup:
 *	- The original pawn is re-possessed by client 1's player controller.
 *	- The test pawn is registered to be auto-destroyed by the test framework at test end.
