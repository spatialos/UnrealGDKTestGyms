/**
 * Tests that a gameplay ability can be activated on an actor from a non-auth server via the cross-server API.
 * Activation by ability spec, class, tag, and gameplay event are tested.
 * - Setup:
 *	- Two servers, number of clients doesn't matter.
 *	- One test actor is spawned, which has an Ability System Component (ASC) and the ability to be activated already granted to it.
 *	- The test actor is force-delegated to server 2.
 * - Test:
 *	- Server one activates the ability on the actor via it's ability spec handle.
 *	  Then it waits for confirmation that the ability got activated via a replicated property on the test actor which gets changed by the
 *	  ability's code. If confirmation does not arrive within the step timeout, or if a double activation is detected, the test is failed.
 *	- The above step is repeated for activation by class, gameplay tag and gameplay event.
 * - Cleanup:
 *	- The test actor is registered to be auto-destroyed by the test framework at test end.
